 SpringTrade is a minimalistic stock trading application developed using SpringBoot, focusing on the fundamental concept of database integration and table joins. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to SpringBoot concepts and demonstrates how to establish relationships between entities in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

Key Features:

Entity Relationship Model:

Define two main entities: User and Stock.
Establish a Many-to-Many relationship between users and stocks, as users can have multiple stocks and stocks can be owned by multiple users.
Database Configuration:

Configure Spring Data JPA to interact with the underlying database.
Utilize Hibernate ORM for object-relational mapping and managing entity relationships.
Data Persistence:

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both User and Stock entities.
Persist user and stock data in the database using JpaRepository interfaces.
Joining Tables:

Demonstrate how to perform joins between the User and Stock tables to fetch relevant data.
Use JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries or Spring Data JPA's built-in query methods to retrieve user-specific or stock-specific information.
Integration Testing:

Write integration tests to ensure the correctness of database operations and query executions.
Utilize in-memory databases like H2 for lightweight testing environments.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and provide informative error messages to users.
Utilize Spring's exception handling capabilities to handle common scenarios like data validation errors or database connectivity issues.
Documentation and Comments:

Maintain clear and concise documentation for easy understanding and future reference.
Include inline comments in the codebase to explain the rationale behind certain implementations and enhance readability.
GitHub Repository:

Host the project on GitHub to facilitate collaboration and version control.
Encourage contributions from the community to enhance the project's functionality and code quality.
